/*
The significance of Private, public and protected : 

	Data member
	
		private : The class can access these feilds but the int main() function cant, so 
				by doing this we avoid manually changing of data 
	
	
		public : Lets the other classes use these member and also lets the main function use it 
		
		
		protected : Lets only the class that inherits from it use it. so only parent to child; 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	member function
	
		private : The class can access these function but the int main() function cant, so 
				by doing this we avoid manually changing of data, and also it wont let other classes use it making 
				it completley private for its own member 
	
	
		public : Lets the other classes use these function and also lets the main function use it 
		
		
		protected : Lets only the class that inherits from it use it. so only parent to child. 
					Anything that is protected cant be used in main ;
